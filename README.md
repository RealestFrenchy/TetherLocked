This plugin tethers multiple accounts together via the party feature on Runelite.
Join a party and the accounts have to stay within a set distance of each other. 
If you break the tether alterts you with an overlay and that darkens your screen until your back in range of the tether.
Eventually there will be a "hard-mode" for it that prevents any action other then movement and teleport while the tether is broken.
